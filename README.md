 # ⛸️ Skating Race - Onchain Ice Racing Game     
         
Skating Race is a fully onchain multiplayer ice skating game built with Solidity.      
No tokens. No bets. No rewards. Just pure fun and fair racing on the blockchain.

## 🚀 Overview    
   
- ❄️ Race on an onchain frozen track   
- 🧊 Up to any number of players per race   
- 🛷 Each player skates step by step until finish line 
- ⚡ First one to reach the end wins

## 🛠️ How It Works 

1. **Owner** creates a new race. 
2. **Players** join before the race starts.
3. **Owner** starts the race.  
4. **Players** call `skate()` to move forward one step per transaction.
5. The first to reach the finish line is recorded as the winner.
  
No central control — everything is verifiable and fair onchain.

## 🔧 Deployment

You can deploy the contract using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or via scripts using Hardhat or Foundry.

### 🧪 Example with Remix

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Paste the contents of `SkatingRace.sol`
3. Compile using Solidity `^0.8.0`
4. Deploy contract
5. Use contract functions to create races and play

## 👀 Example Gameplay

```solidity
// Owner creates a race
createRace();

// Players join
joinRace(0); // from different accounts

// Start the race
startRace(0);

// Players race!
skate(0);
skate(0);
// ... until someone wins

// Get winner
getWinner(0);
